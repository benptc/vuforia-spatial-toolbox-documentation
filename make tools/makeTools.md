## API Reference


#### Initialize the Javacript Library
Include the open hybrid functionality by instancing as following in your Java Script code:

```javascript
var toolbox = new Toolbox();
```

Every communication with the object is happening passively. This means that the object is not pushing data. If a user interface wants to read data from a Hybrid Object it first needs to send a read request.

```javascript
toolbox.addReadListener("led", function(e){
  input = e*255;
});
```
You can write to the Hybrid Object with write(). The scale of your values should be between 0.0 and 1.0.

```javascript
toolbox.write("led", output);
```
Send broadcast messages to all other objects currently visible in the Reality Editor.

```javascript
toolbox.sendGlobalMessage("Hello World");
```
Allows you to listen to messages send to all other objects currently visible in the Reality Editor.

```javascript
toolbox.addGlobalMessageListener(function(e){
  console.log(e);
});
```
Allows you to listen to updates 3D-transformations. It only works once subscribeToMatrix() has been called. This listener is synchronized with the video update rate.

```javascript
toolbox.addMatrixListener(function(e,f){
  modelview = e;
  projection = f;
});
```
Forces the Reality Editor to show your content full screen without 3d transformation. This comes in handy for when you want to use the transformation matrices directly.
```javascript
toolbox.setFullScreenOn();
```

Does the oposit from setFullScreenOn. ðŸ™‚
```javascript
toolbox.setFullScreenOff();
```
Allows you read if the interface is visible or not. The interface stays active for 3 seconds after it becomes invisible.
```javascript
toolbox.addVisibilityListener(function(e){
  visible = e;
});
```
Returns a number for translation distance and position between the iOS device and the marker.

```javascript
x =  toolbox.getPositionX();
y =  toolbox.getPositionY();
z =  toolbox.getPositionZ();
```
